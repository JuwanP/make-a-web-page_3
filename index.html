            <h3>Procedural Thinking</h3>
              <p>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear instructions for a computer to follow.</p>
            <h3>Abstract Thinking</h3>
              <p>Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst different things, to avoid repetition in coding.</p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
              <p>Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.</p>
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
              <p>Debugging is a systematic process of identifying the cause of the error in the program.</p>

          <h2>Overview of the Internet</h2>
            <h3>Browsers</h3>
              <p>The browsers send data to the internet (or the cloud) when we type a url, like: <span class="link"><a href="www.google.com">Google</a></span></p>
            <h3>The Internet</h3>
              <p>The internet then gets this data that the browser sent and sends a HTTP request to the servers.</p>
            <h3>Servers</h3>
              <p>The serverâ€™s job is to  find the appropriate file and send the information back to our web browsers display for the user.</p>

          <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

              <p>A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML. Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.</p>
            <h3>What is HTML</h3>
              <p>HTML stands for:  <span class="italic">HyperText Markup Language</span> and is the main type of document on the web. However, it's not the only type file, that can exist on the web. Other files include: PDFs, Images, videos etc.</p>
            <h3>HTML Terms</h3>
              <p><span class="define">Tag:</span> An HTML tag is always surrounded with angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag (&lt;p&gt; for example) and a closing tag, (&lt;/p&gt;). Some tags do not require a closing tag (like the &lt;br&gt; tag). <span class="define">Element:</span> An HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags. <span class="define">Attribute:</span> This is a property of an HTML element.</p><br>
              <p>An overview of HTML would be: <span class="link"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE34jtaJzNc&index=6&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPmd5v7c9i883AwqVZquegHM">here</a></span>

          <h2>CSS Basics</h2>

            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
              <p>CSS stands for <span class="italic">Cascading Style Sheets</span> and is code written to control the "style" of HTML elements. Cascading means that whatever is applied to the top element must apply to the rest following it, until specified later in the code.</p>
